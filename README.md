# host-management-openstack

Kubernetes controller that manages bare metal hosts via OpenStack Ironic. Watches HostLease CRs (defined in [bare-metal-fulfillment-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator)) and reconciles power state with Ironic.

## Description

This controller filters HostLease CRs where `spec.hostClass == "openstack"` and uses `spec.externalID` as the Ironic node UUID. It reconciles the desired power state (`spec.poweredOn`) against the actual Ironic node power state, polling until they match.

Key behaviors:
- `spec.poweredOn = true` — powers on the node via Ironic
- `spec.poweredOn = false` — powers off the node via Ironic
- `spec.poweredOn = nil` — unmanaged; skips power reconciliation
- Sets `status.conditions[PowerSynced]` to reflect sync state
- Requeues with a configurable interval (`HOST_RECHECK_INTERVAL`, default 60s) until power state matches

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
go test ./internal/... ./cmd/...

# Run controller tests only
go test ./internal/controller/ -v

# Run ironic client tests only
go test ./internal/ironic/ -v
```

## Test Locally (with Ironic)

Run the controller on your machine and point it at your Ironic API. You need a Kubernetes API (e.g. a `kind` cluster) so the controller can watch HostLease CRs.

### 1. Create a kind cluster

```bash
kind create cluster --name host-mgmt-test
```

### 2. Install the HostLease CRD from bare-metal-fulfillment-operator

The HostLease CR is defined in the [bare-metal-fulfillment-operator](https://github.com/osac-project/bare-metal-fulfillment-operator).

```bash
kubectl apply -f <path-to-bare-metal-fulfillment-operator>/config/crd/bases/osac.openshift.io_hostleases.yaml
```

### 3. Run the controller

The controller uses standard OpenStack authentication via `OS_CLOUD` (or `OS_*` env vars). Configure a `clouds.yaml` with your Ironic endpoint, then:

```bash
OS_CLOUD=<your-cloud-name> make run
```

### 4. Apply a sample HostLease CR

In another terminal:

```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/v1alpha1_hostlease.yaml
```

### 5. Verify

```bash
# Check HostLease status
kubectl get hostlease hostlease-sample -n osac-namespace -o yaml

# Watch controller logs for reconciliation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.25.0+
- podman (or docker)
- kubectl version v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster
- Access to an OpenStack Ironic endpoint

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make image-build image-push IMG=<some-registry>/host-management-openstack:tag
```

**Install the HostLease CRD (from bare-metal-fulfillment-operator):**

```sh
kubectl apply -f <path-to-bare-metal-fulfillment-operator>/config/crd/bases/osac.openshift.io_hostleases.yaml
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/host-management-openstack:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```
